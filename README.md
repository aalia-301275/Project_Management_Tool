📊 Core Functionality
Projects act as containers for tasks
Each task has a status (To Do, In Progress, Done)
Progress bar dynamically updates based on task completion
All data is stored in MongoDB via REST API
🧠 Future Improvements
User authentication system (Login/Register with JWT)
Password encryption using bcrypt
User-specific project dashboards
Role-based access control (Admin/User)
Drag and drop task management (Trello-style UI)
Dark mode theme support
Due dates and reminders for tasks
🤖 AI-Assisted Development (Transparency Note)

Parts of this project, especially JavaScript logic and debugging, were developed with the assistance of AI tools (ChatGPT).

However:

All code was reviewed, understood, and tested manually
Backend architecture, API structure, and database design were implemented by me
UI design and feature decisions were made independently
AI was used as a learning and debugging aid
🎯 Learning Outcomes
Built a full-stack web application
Learned REST API development
Implemented CRUD operations
Integrated frontend with backend
Practiced state management in vanilla JavaScript
